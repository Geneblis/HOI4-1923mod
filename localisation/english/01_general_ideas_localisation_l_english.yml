BRA_tenentism_rise:0 "Rise of Tenentismo"
BRA_tenentism_rise_desc:0 "§RIf not eliminated soon, the tenentists will only become bolder...§! \n\nPopular dissatisfaction with the brazilian government is soaring high. Unhappy with the current status-quo due to economic stagnation, unfair and elitist elections and a incompetent government, the lower officers of the army are more often then not adhering to the Tenentismo, a political movement seeking to overthrow the current order in favor of a Brazil more true to its supposed republican and democratic values. Although focused around the army, they are quite popular among the urban and rural poor, too."
BRA_cafecomleite:0 "Café-Com-Leite Politics"
BRA_cafecomleite_desc:0 "§HOur government will have§! §Rserious§! §Hproblems if São Paulo and Minas Gerais have a conflict in interests...§!\n\nBrazilian Politics has, ever since the end of the ''Republic of the Sword'', been resumed to a pact between Minas Gerais and São Paulo elites, the so-called ''Café-Com-Leite'' politics. There has not been a single election since the proclamation of the Republic that has been fully legitimate and had popular participation, as not only the voting booths are administered by the local ruling parties, but the open system of voting (where its public knowledge who voted for who) is a effective way to intimidate voters into voting for the current political estabilishment."
