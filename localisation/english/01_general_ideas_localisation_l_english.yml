BRA_tenentism_rise_desc:0 "Popular dissatisfaction with the brazilian government is soaring high. Unhappy with the current status-quo due to economic stagnation, unfair and elitist elections and a incompetent government, the lower officers of the army are more often then not adhering to the Tenentismo, a political movement seeking to overthrow the current order in favor of a Brazil more true to its supposed republican and democratic values.
