BRA_tenentism_rise:0 "Rise of Tenentismo"
BRA_tenentism_rise_desc:0 "§RIf not eliminated soon, the tenentists will only become bolder...§! \n\nPopular dissatisfaction with the brazilian government is soaring high. Unhappy with the current status-quo due to economic stagnation, unfair and elitist elections and a incompetent government, the lower officers of the army are more often then not adhering to the Tenentismo, a political movement seeking to overthrow the current order in favor of a Brazil more true to its supposed republican and democratic values. Although focused around the army, they are quite popular among the urban and rural poor, too."
BRA_cafecomleite:0 "Café-Com-Leite Politics"
BRA_cafecomleite_desc:0 "§HOur government will have§! §Rserious§! §Hproblems if São Paulo and Minas Gerais have a conflict in interests...§!\n\nBrazilian Politics has, ever since the end of the ''Republic of the Sword'', been resumed to a pact between Minas Gerais and São Paulo elites, the so-called ''Café-Com-Leite'' politics. There has not been a single election since the proclamation of the Republic that has been fully legitimate and had popular participation, as not only the voting booths are administered by the local ruling parties, but the open system of voting (where its public knowledge who voted for who) is a effective way to intimidate voters into voting for the current political estabilishment."

AFG_modernist_constitution:0 "Modernist Constitution"
AFG_modernist_constitution_desc:0 "The current constitution of the Kingdom of Afghanistan is quite unique in its history. Inspired by western documents, this constitution was made with the intent of modernizing our nation, which is considered a backwater internationally. While no doubt being a impressive achievment, it is not without criticism, as the traditionally conservative population of our nation and the elites oppose it strongly."
AFG_tribal_rebellions:0 "Tribal Rebellions"
AFG_tribal_rebellions_desc:0 "The reformist outlook of our government has not gone unnoticed. The ban on veils for woman and the opening up of co-educational schools for both genders, alongside with obrigatory elementary education has stirred up many tribal leaders, which are reacting with open disloyalty. §RShould this behaviour not be punished, our government will face dire issues.§!"
AFG_saqqawists:0 "The Saqqawists"
AFG_saqqawists_desc:0 "§RLeft unchecked, the Saqqawists will only pose a ever greater threat.§!\n\nThe Saqqawists, a group of islamic conservatives that oppose our goverment, are a permanent nuisance towards us. Taking advantage of the already fragile balance of things due to the ever advancing modenizartion of our nation, these radicals will take upon any opportunity to siege the government and revert all the progress we have made. They must be stopped."
